High-Throughput Screening Method to Find Metal-Organic Frameworks for CO2 Hydrogenation

Method Contains 4 Screening Tiers with Additional Properties Added to Passing Materials

Screens

1. Porosity - First Principle Screen - (https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.2c05155) - The Porosity of the MOF needs to allow for CO2, CH4, and H20 to pass through the structures pores, A size safe size to allow this to happen would be 4.5A. 
2. Bandgap - First Principle Screen - (Adjusted by https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202003792) - The Bandgap of the materials needs to be greater than 1.2 eV to allow for light assisted hydrogenation to take place in the material.
3. Water Stability - Machine Learning Screen - (https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.4c05879) - The material needs to be stable if water is produced during the reverse water gas shift reaction, only the most highly stable materials are selected.
4. MOF Structure Stability - Machine Learning Screen - (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01181-0) - The material needs to be stable when it is being synthesized, only the most highly stable materials are selected.

Additional Properties

5. Gas Adsorption and CO2/N2 Selectivity - Machine Learning - (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1798-7) - The material should have a high gas adsoption energy to allow for many CO2 molecules to fill the material to allow for high conversion rates.
6. Thermal Degradation Temperature - Machine Learning - (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01181-0) - The material needs to withstand high temperatures needed to commence the hydrogenation reaction.
